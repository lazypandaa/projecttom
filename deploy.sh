# This script automates the build and deployment of a web project to a Tomcat server.
# It's designed to be more robust and flexible for use in a CI/CD pipeline like Jenkins.

# --- Script Configuration ---
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
# This ensures that the script will stop if any step fails.
set -e

# --- Variables ---
# The script now accepts the Tomcat deployment path as an argument.
# If you don't provide an argument when running the script, it will use the default path.
# This makes it easy to configure in Jenkins without changing the script itself.
